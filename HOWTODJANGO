To deploy the Django project on your local machine*

*on Ubuntu.

Install python 2.7, if you haven't already.

Install pip and Django:

> sudo apt-get install python-pip
> sudo pip install Django==1.5.4

Assuming you've already cloned the project, cd into the 
cdc_mmwr_liberation directory and create the following empty files:

> touch wonder/local_settings.py
> touch wonder.db

Open up the wonder/settings.py file in your favourite text editor.
Copy the code for the object DATABASES to your empty local_settings.py 
file. Edit the 'NAME' field to contain the path to the empty sqlite3 db
you just created called wonder.db. Then sync the database:

> python manage.py syncdb

You should go ahead and create a superuser at this point.

> python manage.py runserver 8080 &

The project should now be running on localhost:8080
